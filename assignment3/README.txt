Instructions for running code in Project 3

All of the code is checked in the following Public Github repo:

https://github.com/kurtn718/CS7641/tree/main/assignment3

Listed below are the explicit dependencies required to run and execute the code.  These python packages may in turn require other packages to be installed (but that should hopefully automatically be done for you when installing these packages)

Dependencies:  Python 3.9, scikit-learn 1.0.2, pandas 1.4.0, numpy 1.22.2, matplotlib 3.5.1, clock 0.1

The file clustering.py contains all the code to run the Cluster experiments

To run these, executing something like python3 ./clustering.py from the terminal should be sufficient.   The author executed the code in these python scripts in the Pycharm IDE.

Instructions for running code in Project 1

All of the code is checked in the following Public Github repo:

https://github.com/kurtn718/CS7641/tree/main/assignment1

Listed below are the explicit dependencies required to run and execute the code.  These python packages may in turn require other packages to be installed (but that should hopefully automatically be done for you when installing these packages)

Dependencies:  Python 3.9, scikit-learn 1.0.2, pandas 1.4.0, numpy 1.22.2, matplotlib 3.5.1, clock 0.1

Each of the individual learners for the project are in their own Python file and have a main function in them that is responsible for generating the graphs in the turned in report.

KNN.py
NeuralNetwork.py
SVM.py
Boosting.py
DecisionTree.py

To run these, executing something like python3 ./KNN.py from the terminal should be sufficient.   The author executed in these scripts in the Pycharm IDE.

Next project, I will try and have everything in a single Jupyter notebook to make things a little easier to run.
